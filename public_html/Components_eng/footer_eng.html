            <p>The website was created after facing several difficulties in finding doctors who treated trans people with respect. I started to realize that the only way to get such care would be through recommendations from others, but as a young person with few contacts, this proved to be quite challenging, especially considering insurance, location, etc. Moreover, in a conversation with a mastectomy surgeon, she told me that she loves performing masculinizing mastectomies and working with trans people, but sometimes it is also difficult for her to find patients, as it often depends on word-of-mouth. That's when I had the idea to create a way to centralize this information and make the search easier for both sides.</p>
            <p>I hope you like the site; please give suggestions, report bugs, suggest changes, and if I have done anything problematic, let me know using one of the contact methods on the side. The site has no profit intentions, but there is a cost associated with maintaining it, so if you'd like to help, you can donate via my Pix. Thank you very much for using my site; I hope it is useful!</p>
